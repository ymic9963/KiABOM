Usage
=====
KiABOM detects the use of an 'MPN' field in the schematic symbols. The field name is **specific** and **case sensitive**. It also ignores searching for part numbers with the values 'Generic', 'TBD', and 'Manufacturer's Stock' in the MPN field. Therefore, to use KiABOM, create an MPN field in each symbol and add the MPN in that field description.

You can use the generator either through the terminal or through KiCad itself. It is **recommended** to use it through a terminal application because of the real-time feedback the script provides. If done through KiCad the script output will only be visible once done. See the relevant sections below for more information and the :ref:`Example Uses <example_uses>` section for some example command options.

Supports all modern KiCad versions using Python v3.11+. If any issues arise please see the :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>` section below first, then if your issue persists please create an issue on the repository.

Using Through a Terminal
-------------------------
KiABOM can be treated (depending on your installation) as an executable application or a Python script. In both cases options would be passed to it the same way. See the :ref:`Options <options>` section for the list of options and example commands you can use with the tool.

Using Through KiCad
---------------------
There are three ways of using KiABOM through KiCad. One is via the Legacy BOM generator menu, the second one is the netlist exporter, and the third one is with a jobset file. First two methods use the Generator command line format as specified in the `KiCad documentation`_. The options used with each method also get saved by KiCad, so you only need to set your configuration once.

.. _KiCad Documentation: https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/en/eeschema/eeschema.html#generator-command-line-format

.. _commands:

Depending on how KiABOM was installed, you may want to use different commands. If using the executable you would use,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom "%I" [options]

It also could be an absolute path to the ``kiabom.exe``.

If using a Python installation you would use,

.. code-block:: text

    python path/to/kiabom.py "%I" [options]

And if using a Python virtual environment you would use,

.. code-block:: text

    path/to/python/venv/bin/python /path/to/kiabom.py "%I" [options]

These commands use the current schematic's XML as input to KiABOM.

Via Legacy BOM Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. In any schematic go to `Tools -> Generate Legacy Bill of Materials...` and click the `+` sign under the 'BOM generator scripts'.

2. Find either the KiABOM executable or Python file, select it, and add an appropriate generator name.

3. Depending on your installation the command in the text box will change. See the  :ref:`commands <commands>` listed above for which commands to use. 

4. Clicking `Generate` should then output the auto-generated BOM in the project root directory.

This method is the recommended method as you can see the output of KiABOM in the dialogue box if anything fails.

Via Netlist Exporter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. First open the schematic editor in any project and go to `File -> Export -> Netlist...`.

2. Click Add Exporter, add the title KiABOM and depending on your installation the command in the text box will change. See the  :ref:`commands <commands>` listed above for which commands to use. 

3. Clicking `Export Netlist` should then output the auto-generated BOM in the project root directory.

This method is only listed to show that it is possible and it is definitely viable even if it's not the recommended way. The only quirks with this method is that there is no feedback to the user of what happened, and it is done through the Netlist generator.

Via a Jobsets File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. To use KiABOM with a jobsets file, the schematic XML must also be generated. To accomplish this, in a jobsets file create a ``Special: Execute Command`` job type and in the ``Command:`` text box, enter the following to generate the schematic XML file,

.. code-block:: text

    kicad-cli sch export netlist -o "${JOBSET_OUTPUT_WORK_PATH}/${PROJECTNAME}-bom.xml" --format kicadxml "${PROJECTNAME}.kicad_sch"

2. Then create another job of the same type and input your KiABOM command with your options, as given in the previous two sections. Depending on your installation the command in the text box will change. See the  :ref:`commands <commands>` listed above for which commands to use. Shown below is an example command,

.. code-block:: text

   kiabom "${JOBSET_OUTPUT_WORK_PATH}${PROJECTNAME}-bom.xml" -o "${JOBSET_OUTPUT_WORK_PATH}${PROJECTNAME}-bom.csv"

**Note:** Due to jobsets not using format specifiers, instead of ``%I`` you would use ``${PROJECTNAME}`` as used in step 1 above.

3. Make sure to save this jobsets file.

Using With Supplier BOM Tools
--------------------------------
Some suppliers offer BOM tools that assist with ordering parts if you already have the MPNs or the Supplier Order Codes. Using KiABOM's CSV output format, the BOM can be uploaded to these tools, and by specifying the correct column types, the parts can be automatically detected and then ordered. See below for example instructions for how to do that with `Mouser's BOM Tool`_. `DigiKey myLists`_ is their version of a BOM tool and has a very similar process.  

.. _Mouser's BOM Tool: https://www.mouser.co.uk/bom/
.. _DigiKey myLists: https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/mylists/

KiABOM provides some options to help with this process specifically. For example, the ``--no-headers`` column might need to be used to get rid of the column headers before inputting to a BOM tool. Also using ``--remove-ignore-mpn-parts`` will remove parts with the ignore MPN values from the BOM, thus saving you time removing these from the result list.

For example, if using Mouser as your supplier, first you generate a BOM using Mouser as one of the suppliers. Go to the Mouser BOM tool and upload your BOM CSV file. In the next page you will set the column types. Assuming you are using the `default` column preset, set the `Quantity` column as `Quantity 1`, `Description` as `Description`, `Manufacturer` as `Mfr Name`, `MPN` as `Mfr Part Number`, and the `Order Code` as the `Mouser Part Number`. In the next page set the appropriate settings and once done proceed to the next page. From here you can add the parts listed to your basket and submit an order. Multiples of the same BOM can be added to basket for multiple boards using the same BOM for a single board.


.. _advanced customisations:

Advanced Customisations
-------------------------
KiABOM is written such that it is as portable and as easy to understand as possible. For this reason, advanced users are encouraged to edit the source code for having their custom column and group presets. After modifying the source `pyinstaller` can then be used to generate an executable if desired by doing,

.. code-block:: text

    pyinstaller src/kiabom.py -F --add-data LICENSE:. --icon images/kiabom-icon.ico

Adding User Custom Presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To add custom column presets add a dictionary entry to the ``column_preset_dict`` defined after the import statements. Any of the listed supported column values (shown by using the ``--list-supported-columns`` option) can be entered and then your preset can then be used by using the ``--column-preset PRESET`` option.

For custom grouping presets it is the same process but by using the ``group_preset_dict`` and by specifying yourcustom preset with ``--group-preset PRESET``. A limitation placed for the group presets is that they should contain at least the ``Value`` and ``Footprint`` group values. This is in place to promote a good standard of BOM generation.

Both of these preset groups can be used together by specifying ``--preset PRESET`` which uses ``preset_dict`` to specify both the group and column presets. The presets in this variable are in a ``COLUMNS PRESET, GROUP PRESET`` format. See below for an example on how to use these variables for customisation (dots imply ommission of the other entries),

.. code-block:: python
   
    column_preset_dict = {
        .
        .
        .
        "custom-columns": [
            "Value",
            "Footprint",
            "MPN",
            "Custom Field",
        ],
    }

    group_preset_dict = {
        .
        .
        .
        "custom-group": [
            "Value",
            "Footprint",
            "Custom Field",
        ],
    }

    preset_dict = {
        .
        .
        .
        "custom": [
            "custom-columns",
            "custom-groups",
        ],
    }

Then your custom preset can be used with,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input_xml --preset custom

.. _options:

.. _example_uses:

Example Uses
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The examples listed here will assume the executable is installed on your system but they could easily be replaced with ``python kiabom.py input_xml [options]``.

Default behaviour for the tool is to generate a CSV in the default column and grouping presets. The auto-generated name of the output is 'input.csv' and will contain headers, will be for 1 board of your schematic, use GBP as the currency, and will retrieve the parts data from the suppliers.

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml

If you do not specify the output with ``-o/--output`` the format of the generated file can be specified with ``-f/--output-format``. If the output is provided then its extension is used and the output format argument is ignored. The default output file name is the XML input file name.

You can fully customise the outputted columns based on the list shown from the ``--list-supported-columns`` option. For example you can create a BOM with no headers, in HTML format, without parts data, that only has the Designator, DNP, Unit/Reel Price, Footprint, and Value,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.html --no-headers --columns "Designator,DNP,Unit/Reel Price,Footprint,Value" --no-kicost

Adding a symbol field to the BOM can be done by using the appropriate preset and appending columns to that. Grouping can also be done on that field.

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --append-columns Rating --append-groups Rating

More information can be outputted than just the parts data like generator info and board quantity by specifying ``--info`` and to get a total price sum by using ``--sum``.

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --sum --info

Datasheets can be downloaded by specifying ``--download-datasheets``, which downloads the files located at the links in the 'Datasheet' symbol field in a 'datasheets' folder in the current directory. The symbols with the 'Exclude From BOM' and 'Exclude From Board' properties can also be used in the BOM with ``--kefbom`` and ``--kefboard``. 

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --download-datasheets --kefbom --kefboard

Currently only two suppliers are supported (Mouser and DigiKey), but in the future the suppliers will be specified with the appropriate options.

Presets can be used to simplify the columns and groupings used in the BOM. For example to output a BOM for JLCPCB, you would execute,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --preset jlcpcb

which is the same as,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --columns-preset jlcpcb --group-preset jlcpcb

Using the command above you can mix and match columns and group presets,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml -o output.csv --columns-preset default --group-preset minimal

Contributions are welcome for any presets or columns you would like the generator to support!

To customise cache behaviour, you can specify if you would like to use cache that is older than the default TTL of 1 day, e.g. 31 days,

.. code-block:: text

    kiabom input.xml --cache-ttl 2678400

If you would like to refresh the cache for this run you can set the cache TTL to 0.

Lastly, editing the generator file is encouraged to fully customise your BOM generation. See the  :ref:`Advanced Customisations <advanced customisations>` section for how to customise KiABOM's source code to get more out of the generator. 

.. _troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the script hangs at any point, simply force-stop its execution in any way possible and retry. This was noted in some cases where the DigiKey API keys had to be authenticated, and the tool did not resume normal function until a restart. However, the tool still continued to cache the parts normally, so the subsequent run was much faster.

Restarting its execution in some cases might mean to exit the terminal or to end the running KiCad process. Therefore it's important to save your work before running KiABOM, especially before the first run so that all APIs have been authenticated and are functional.
