Comparisons
===========
On this page you will find some comparisons between other popular BOM generators and KiABOM. This is meant to fully inform you of what KiABOM does differently.

KiABOM
------
- KiCad only.
- Simple unformatted BOM generation, which also retrieves part data from suppliers.
- Supported output formats are CSV, HTML, TXT, and XLSX.
- Uses the ``kicad_netlist_reader`` module that ships with KiCad and does not do its own XML parsing.
- Optional config file for API keys, and has command line options for further configuration.
- Handles schematic property fields like 'DNP', 'Exclude from Board', and 'Exclude from BOM', as they appear on the schematic.
- Ignores MPNs like 'Generic','TBD','Manufacturer's Stock', and '' (blank).
- Currently supports Mouser and DigiKey.
- Implements presets to simplify commands and to promote user customisation.
- Single script file.

KiCost
------
- Supports Altium, Proteus, Eagle, Upverter and hand made CSVs.
- Outputs a fully formatted XLSX spreadsheet file with supplier parts data.
- Only supports XLSX as the output format.
- Uses BeautifulSoup4 for reading the input XML and then does its own parsing for the part data.
- Config file for cache lifetime and API keys, and uses command line options for configurating the BOM.
- Does not handle schematic property fields like 'DNP', 'Exclude from Board', and 'Exclude from BOM', without adding extra fields to the symbol.
- Can ignore MPNs but they need to be specified with an option.
- Supports multiple suppliers.

KiBoM
-----
- KiCad only.
- Simple unformatted BOM generation with no supplier parts data.
- Supported output formats are CSV, HTML, TXT, TSV, XML, XLSX.
- Uses its own method with modified KiCad netlist reader source code to minimise dependencies.
- Mostly configured through a config file with many options.
- Does not handle schematic property fields like 'DNP', 'Exclude from Board', and 'Exclude from BOM', without adding extra fields to the symbol.
- Auto-detects the output file extension and sets the format.
- Repository is archived.
