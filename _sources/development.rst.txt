Development
===========
To continue development, make sure to install the requirements in `requirements.txt`,

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -r src/requirements.txt

and also by using pyintaller (confirmed tested version is v6.12.0) to make it into a single executable using,

.. code-block:: text

    pyinstaller src/kiabom.py -F --add-data LICENSE:. --icon images/kiabom-icon.ico

Lastly, a `config.yaml` file with your API keys would need to be placed next to `kiabom.py` to succesfully run the tests. In the future there may be changes in the supplier's API data structures or part numbers could mean different things. This will affect the 'expected' results from the testing, and therefore would have to be updated accordingly.

Using `Ruff`_ as the linter and formatter, pytest for testing and coverage, and pyright as the static type checker.

Philosophy
----------
- KiABOM should minimise the effort needed to create a Bill Of Materials in KiCad as much as possible, while also minimising complexity.
- Should always be thought of as a Bill Of Materials generator script written in Python, and not as a Python application.
- Should aim to have as few source files and configuration files as possible, to ensure portability as a BOM script.
- The schematic should always be the source of truth, and it should always base the component information and groups from the schematic using the KiCad netlist reader.
- Very little (if any) formatting should be done of the final output, leaving all formatting for the user to do after generation.
